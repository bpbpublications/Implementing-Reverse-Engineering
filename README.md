# Implementing Reverse Engineering

The Real Practice of X86 Internals, Code Calling Conventions, Ransomware Decryption, Application Cracking, Assembly Language, and Proven Cybersecurity Open Source Tools

This is the repository for [Implementing Reverse Engineering](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/implementing-reverse-engineering?_pos=1&_sid=513dd22ca&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
The book ‘Implementing Reverse Engineering’ begins with a step-by-step explanation of the fundamentals of reverse engineering. You will learn how to use reverse engineering to find bugs and hacks in real-world applications. This book is divided into three sections. The first section is an exploration of the reverse engineering process. The second section explains reverse engineering of applications, and the third section is a collection of real-world use-cases with solutions.

The first section introduces the basic concepts of a computing system and the data building blocks of the computing system. This section also includes open-source tools such as CFF Explorer, Ghidra, Cutter, and x32dbg. The second section goes over various reverse engineering practicals on various applications to give users hands-on experience. In the third section, reverse engineering of Wannacry ransomware, a well-known Windows application, and various exercises are demonstrated step by step.

In a very detailed and step-by-step manner, you will practice and understand different assembly instructions, types of code calling conventions, assembly patterns of applications with the printf function, pointers, array, structure, scanf, strcpy function, decision, and loop control structures. You will learn how to use open-source tools for reverse engineering such as portable executable editors, disassemblers, and debuggers.
 
## What you will learn
* Understand different code calling conventions like CDECL, STDCALL, and FASTCALL with practical illustrations.
* Analyze and break WannaCry ransomware using Ghidra.
* Using Cutter, reconstruct application logic from the assembly code.
* Hack the Windows calculator to modify its behavior.
